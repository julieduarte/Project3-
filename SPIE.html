<h1>Socal-Political-intellectual-Economic</h1>
<p><font color=#051021><font size="6"Our Social Structure is: The society contributes by men bring or kill the animal for meat, protect the soceity, serve in military  we get our milk from sheep and goats the sheep and goats were also made for the tents and male clothing no man was less than another we are a  equal soceity no one is wealthier or poorer than another man or women ,also men and women have equal rights all male (army) beginings in the toddler years male toddlers learn how to ride sheep because they dont know how to ride horses yet . there tasks with their miniture bows was to learn how to shoot rodents and birds . When older males graduate their tasks of mastering the bow and arrow they can get their own horse to ride and they need to train the horses to go imto battle our laws are inspired by our god Adeo </p></font>

<p><font color=#051021><font size="6"Our Economic System is: <p> For economics, we trade with our fellow neighbors. To travel we ride on horses. We trade with horses, cheese and other foods to get wood and iron in return. We don’t have a currency but trade. We produce cheese, milk and raise horses and other domestic animals in our farms. We get the cheese and milk from cows and goats. As well as, the animals skins, to make tents bags carry the goods, and horns to carry liquids, such as milk and water. Men gather food and is not paid in return, but his personal materials can be traded with someone else's owning, even someone from another society. Women are allowed to trade as well. Guevarians get their knowledge from other societies because before trading, all they knew is their religious beliefs and education in war, learning military skills. Now because of trading, they know how to read, write, math and philosophy. This is passed down from generation to generation where now the tribe knows a bit more knowledge than before.</p></font>

<p><font color=#051021><font size="6"Our intellectual System is:<p> So to start off with we are Monotheistic, and monotheistic means, relating to or characterized by the belief that there is only one God. We believe that, there is only one God and that’s Adeo. Our people, core value is to the “submission to God” Now under him who helped us as the society, were the Priest and Prophets, our religious leaders who run the tabernacle services, and who were constantly in prayer. They were there to help us get through our problems if needed. The prophets are like our fortune tellers, who warn us if it’s fine to travel to a certain direction, the weather, if we will win  a war, etc. Although we accomplished many things, although we were able to overcome things that weren’t possible for all, we still had our own minor problems. So we could stay sane and not go crazy the priest were there. Teaching us the word of God, praying with us, fellow shipping with us and many more things just so we can give our time to God (Adeo) as well. The belief of the afterlife is that all men and women go to a place called Zanidus(heaven). Zanidus is the reward when you are a good soul who and does the work of Adeo. Adeo will send you to the dimension of where Adeo is and you will remain there for eternity. Beliefs consist that people of the scriptures and Guevarous himself, is up in the kingdom of Zanidus. For the sinners and evildoers they go to a place called Perdition. In there they will suffer for eternity for the disrespect Adeo. As for festivals and holidays,  we sacrifice animals for Adeo, by the tabernacle. As for weddings occur through religious pathway, and then there is a afterdance around the statue of Adeo. When young males, have reach certain age, they are graduated to their own horse, because we have the mindset to military skills.</p></font>

<p><font color=#051021><font size="6"Our Political System is:<p>The Political structure of our tribe is theocracy, it is ruled under a religion and that runs the political side and many other aspects of this tribe. The government figure is a chief, he enforces the law and demands the Guevarians what to do. He is in charge and is selected by the priest who is anointed and selected by our god Adeo. The chief demands whether the tribe should migrate, or stay in a spot. He is allowed to carry punishments if necessary and rewards if necessary. He is the figure and the head of the tribe and they must obey him, he is under the law as well. Chiefs are males and has assistance along in his rule, they are rewarded with his gratitude and his full respect. When he is gone, they are usually automatic chosen by the priest to lead the next chief. The chief is in the chief’s tent where the soldiers remain. The chief’s area is surrounded by forts and only special request men are allowed to visit the chief. Not anyone is to see him. A priest is selected by the prophets, which are told by Adeo who is to be next head of the tribe. A priest selection is a different because not anyone can be a priest. He must be a holy man, must be pure and must be an adult male, anointed by Adeo. A priest job is to make sure everyone knows the word of Adeo. He is too pray for needs, assemble the worship at the tabernacle and dismiss the guevarians. He presents the law and the word at the tabernacle and is allowed to call out punishments and demands the chief to carry it. There is a council of 5 priest who all agree to select a chief. Whenever a chief is reported a terrible chief and if more than 10 Guevarians claim he is a bad chief, he will be removed from his place and will select another chief. These arrangements happen only in the tabernacle. If a chief was caught sinning against Adeo and against the priest and prophets, he will be expelled from the ministry and will be forced to work hard labor till death. If a priest is to sin against the ministry, he will be expelled from the council and be forced to work hard labor until death. Priest are in the tabernacle at all times, praying and speaking with god, unless it’s time for the tribe to move. Priest sleep in their private tents by the tabernacle. Priest allow anyone to the tabernacle, even in non-service hours, unless they feel like worshiping and praying. Prophets are in their secluded area of the tribe. He is focused on Adeo and is constantly in a prayer and fasting. If one disturbs the prophet from prayer he shall be punished. Prophets are able to speak when he isn’t praying, when he summons a Guevarian, or when he is in the tabernacle. He sleeps in his private tent but is only their for slumber. If an elder or prophet sins against the ministry,( he will be smited by Adeo) he will be punished and expelled from the ministry. A prophet is selected by “Adeo” ( it is hereditary). The bloodline of prophet don’t get riches, he is to study all his life of the lord and must participate in priest and council actions. He is then selected when by the past prophet who is usually the father of him. He is selected and becomes the prophet. He is the holiest man and selects the council. All priest, prophets, and chiefs don’t get currency for their position. All they do is spread Adeo’s word, and leading the people through his path.</p></font>

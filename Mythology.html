<h1>Mythology<h1/>
<p><font color=#e81717>  Their was a soldier named General Tommy, who was everyoneâ€™s favorite. General Tommy was then order by the captain to choose ten strongest men to go with him on journey to deliver a message to another kingdom. In the middle of the journey General Tommy and the soldiers were attacked by the Rubkuhs. Little did the men know that one of the ten soldiers named Lieutenant Ruben strongly disliked General Tommy. So because Lieutenant Ruben envied General Tommy, Ruben had a meeting with the Rubkuhs to attack Gerneral Tommy and his men.
General Tommy was the first to be killed, slowly after that a few of the men started dying slowly  except for a soldier named Kingstan who looked up to General Tommy. Kingstan, so calm and quiet, snuck off and   immediately  took off  and told the rest   of the Guevarians the tragic news.  A few weeks went by and the Guevarians were ready to go to war with the Rubkhus, in honor of General Tommy. 
		After the victory against the Rubkuhs, people started to believe that General Tommy was at peace. Many people believed that his soul rested peacefully in Zanidus giving all his praise to Adeo. Meanwhile, a despiteful man named Lieutenant Ruben,  who was brutally killed on the battlefield, suffered in pardination. 

* this relates to our civilization because everyone wanted to go to Zanidus</font></b></p>

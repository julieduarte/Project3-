<p><font color=#e1ff00><font size="6"> As I turned the corner of the hall, I suddenly find myself against the floor. The feeling of her rough hands beating against my face and my body felt as if I were getting jumped by a group of females. There I was laying on the floor so helplessly trying to block every hit but failed, I can see such rave and anger in her faces. A sudden ringing appears in my ears and every motion began to move slower as the beating kept getting worse. As I felt myself slowly drifting off, my eyes open wide, waking up from yet another horrible dream. It felt as if it was only a dream, but the thought that I have to deal with the Foster Monster….  I am already living a horrible dream. Hi, my name is Aria Gilmore, and I am a 16 year old stuck in the crappiest foster system. I consider myself to be very shy and act as if I am invisible.
 I have so much hatred towards my foster monster, but I never have the guts to stand up to her. Despite this horrible situation happening at home, it felt as if the monster was everywhere. I was only in the first grade when everything my life had switched up. I remember coming that day ready to tell my mom about my day. But once i got there, a police officer had come to let me and my sister that was two years older than me, that we had to go with him. We were confused and didn’t have a clue as to what was going on. The police man tried the best he can to tell us the bad news, that our parents had past away in a terrible car accident. He quickly explained the process that was going to happen after our parents funeral. After the funeral, me and my sister had been split up and I haven’t heard from her since then. 
When I reached the third grade, that’s when uncovered the fact that I am not like others. I was able to do things that no one can do. Over the years I’ve learned to master my “special gifts”. I have no one to turn to, so I’m am alone in this, but yet I’m not scared. The only thing that I fear the most is not being able to control my gifts. I have promised myself that I will never use my gifts towards anyone unless it was for a good cause. One day The Monster came storming into my room and I can smell the booze in her breath from a mile away. She struck me complaining that I have behaving like I have no sense, when in reality I have done nothing to piss her off. With no hesitation I accidently struck her with a full force that made her fall back.
 She quickly stood up trying to re-attack but I quickly became invisible and ran out quickly.   I had noticed that she did not come out yet, in my head i was happy, but then again I was mad at the fact that my secret had come out to the one person that I never wanted to find out.Things cooled down and the monster had not said one word to me since that day. I still couldn't believe that she knows about my gifts. That evening she had been acting different towards me, I walked to the kitchen as the monster summons me and there I find the table full of home cook meals. My first thought was that she was trying to get back at me for what had happened, but the monster made it seem that she had no intention to. I slowly sat down as she started making me my plate, once she handed me my plate she explained that she never wanted to treat me the way she treated me. Tears began to fall from her face as she tried to apologies for everything and I was too gullible to believe everywhere. 
I didn't know what to feel just the fact that she showing me love, is all that I ever wanted but it didn't last long. It had got even more strange when the monster had told me I didn't have to do my chores and that i can go bed. As soon as she said that, I knew that she was up to something. I fell asleep but I had a weird feeling that followed into my dreams. All of a sudden, i find myself sitting down in the basement, wrapped tightly with ropes and duct tape covering my mouth. I didn't understand what was going on but I knew the monster had done this to me. She came down and started to beat me, complaining and yelling “WHY WOULD BETRAY ME?” and “THIS IS WHAT YOU GET!” but on the third hit she held back. She went on and on about the plans that she has for me. I am to do whatever she wants me to. It became fun as I got older, me and the monster had gotten closer because of my special gifts. The “tasks” that were assigned to me were outrageous, we took it slow, starting off with liquor stores, and so on and on until the monster was plotting to rob a bank. Since I was able to turn invisible, and create force fields she learned that I will never get caught.The monster went on with the plan and I so easily went along with the plan. My sister from the beginging of the story stopped me from robbing the bank turns out she was tracking me d9wn and the bank she was going to confront me . She did was faught but then we realized who we where it was my blood siste</p></font>
